if a file was deleted and push it using git command -->( git rm -r "today.txt")   and we can recover deleted file using --> (git checkout b5b5d6a^ -- today.txt)
I have commited file but not pushed and I want to uncommit (git reset HEAD^) or (git reset --hard HEAD^)
I have added file but not committed and I want to unadd( git reset) or (git reset <filename>)
I want to create a branch (git checkout -b feature/dev3)
I want to check status (git status)
